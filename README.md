# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch

A Python implementation of machine learning algorithms built from scratch using NumPy. This project focuses on transparency and educational value by implementing algorithms without using high-level ML libraries.

## 🎯 Models

-   **Logistic Regression Implementation**
    -   Gradient Descent optimization
    -   Early stopping mechanism
    -   Lambda regularization
    -   Configurable learning rates
    -   Grid search for hyperparameter tuning
